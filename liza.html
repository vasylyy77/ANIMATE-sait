                    Lisa’s reputation as an advocate and ally started in preschool, when she received top marks in “helping
                    others”. She embraced her calling, spending much of her adult life exploring the mind-body connection,
                    and helping people manage and even conquer their finances.

                    Lisa is a fully registered nerd and loved every part of school, even paying off her college debt, but
                    math was always her favorite subject. To wit, she has a favorite irrational number. It is no surprise
                    that she has found a happy home in financial services: a career that combines her love of helping others
                    and solving complex problems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Prior to founding EmberHouse, Lisa worked as a financial advisor at Morgan Stanley, Mesirow Financial
                    and JPMorgan Chase. Throughout fifteen years of experience in financial services, she has had tens of
                    thousands of opportunities to observe, guide and learn from clients and their money habits. From the way
                    a client spends their paycheck to the way they plan for retirement, Lisa sees a story in every behavior,
                    and is eager to give those stories a happy ending.

                    In her free time, she likes to read, eat yummy food with friends and drink white Burgundy. She is mildly
                    obsessed with longevity and health, and will try pretty much any spa treatment once - the working title
                    of her Great American Novel is Friends and Enemas.
